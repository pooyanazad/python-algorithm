# Hey there, this code does a linear search on a list.
# It checks elements one by one until a match is found or the list ends.

def linear_search(arr, target):
    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value == target:
            return index
    return -1

# Example usage
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(linear_search(numbers, 30))  # Output: 2
print(linear_search(numbers, 50))  # Output: -1 (not found)
