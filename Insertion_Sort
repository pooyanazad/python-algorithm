# Hello buddy, here's Insertion Sort.
# It builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements.

def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j+1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j+1] = key

# Example usage
nums = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertion_sort(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
