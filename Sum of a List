# Hey friend, this code calculates the sum of a list of numbers
# by simply adding each element in a loop. Very straightforward!

def sum_of_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# Example usage
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(sum_of_list(my_list))  # Output: 10
