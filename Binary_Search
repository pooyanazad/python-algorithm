# Hey friend, this code performs a binary search on a sorted list.
# It repeatedly splits the list in half and checks which side the target is on.

def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
sorted_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(binary_search(sorted_numbers, 7))  # Output: 3
print(binary_search(sorted_numbers, 2))  # Output: -1 (not found)
